**GroupDocs.Total for Python via .NET** is a suite of document-processing APIs that together support a very broad range of file formats — from common office documents and PDFs to images, e-mail formats, eBooks and many specialized formats. Each product in the suite focuses on a particular capability (viewing, conversion, comparison, watermarking, metadata handling, merging, assembly, redaction, signature), and every product exposes its own detailed list of supported file types. For the most accurate, product-level information and quick format lookup use the linked product pages below.

> **Note:** Supported formats vary by product and by operation (for example, a format that can be **viewed** may not be **convertible** to every other format). Always check the per-product supported-formats page for the authoritative list.

## Highlights

- **Conversion** supports thousands of conversion combinations and covers a very large set of input/output formats — ideal when you need to convert between many different types.  
- **Viewer** renders documents to HTML, PDF, JPEG and PNG so you can display a wide variety of formats in web or desktop apps.  
- **Comparison** supports common office and text formats (Word, Excel, PowerPoint), OpenDocument (ODT), PDF, text and HTML for document comparison workflows.  
- **Assembly / Metadata** components accept a very large set of formats (the Assembly/Metadata product pages report support for **170+** popular formats), making them suitable for template population and metadata extraction across many document types.  
- **Merger / Redaction / Watermark / Signature** products handle the usual office formats (DOC/DOCX/XLS/XLSX/PPT/PPTX, PDF) plus images, email and other formats frequently used in document processing pipelines.

## Commonly requested formats (examples)

DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, PPT, PPTX, PDF, HTML, TXT, RTF, JPEG, PNG, TIFF, MSG, EML, EPUB, ZIP, TAR, DWG
